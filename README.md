# Year2-Volunteering-App

This was a group project of 8 people that tasked us in making an app in the domains of Charities, Local Businesses or the Environment. We chose to make an app for students to sign up for volunteering opportunities at the University of Bath. Charities made accounts to post about the new opportunities they need volunteers for, and students see these events and sign up for them, exchanging emails to allow them to communicate outside of the app.
